## **Introduction**

CycleTrack is a web-based bicycle rental application designed to simplify the process of renting and managing bicycles for both users and administrators. Inspired by the growing demand for eco-friendly transportation options, the platform enables users to rent bicycles on an hourly basis while allowing administrators to track bicycle availability, user activity, and rental durations. The goal of CycleTrack is to provide an intuitive and efficient experience for both users and admins, making it easy to rent and return bicycles while ensuring accurate billing and seamless management.

This project was developed using **Python Flask** for the backend, **SQLAlchemy** for database operations, and **HTML/CSS** (along with Bootstrap) for the frontend. Key features include user registration, bicycle rental and return logic, real-time availability updates, and automated billing based on rental duration.
